  <p>From the manual:</p>
  <blockquote><p><strong>RAxML</strong> (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a program for sequential and parallel Maximum Likelihood based inference of large phylogenetic trees. It can also be used for post-analyses of sets of phylogenetic trees, analyses of alignments and, evolutionary placement of short reads.</br>It has originally been derived from fastDNAml which in turn was derived from Joe Felsenteinâ€™s dnaml which is part of the PHYLIP package. </p></blockquote>
